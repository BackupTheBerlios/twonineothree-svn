	* 29o3 no longer uses its own file format for layouts.
	  Instead of, "normal" PHP files represent layouts, which
	  enables even more flexibility in 29o3.
	  To get an idea what I mean, have a look at
	  content/layouts/29o3default.php
	  
	  NOTICE: The file ending is subject to change, check
	  this file soon.
	  
	* because 29o3 is not using its own layout format anymore,
	  the "broend_layout" table has been abandoned. Its
	  replacement is the table "broend_layouts", which holds
	  the filenames and internal names of installed layout
	  files.

2004-10-26:
	* Version number bumped to 0.1beta
	* table layout change massively
